I'm Marco Mastropaolo, husband, father of two super-girls, developer of [MoonSharp](http://www.moonsharp.org) and [Waking Violet](https://www.wakingviolet.com/) and tons of other useless stuff (see homepage). Views mine, not my employer's. Maybe not even mine (above all, not my employer's).

If you need further details, that's why I have a [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcomastropaolo/)

### Contact me

DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mxanathar), [GitHub](https://github.com/xanathar/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcomastropaolo/).

Don't be afraid to contact me for anything, but don't get offended if the answer takes ages to arrive - I'm that lazy.

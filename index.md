I'm Marco Mastropaolo: husband, father of two super-girls, foodie, and I like to spend time building fake things - I mean, software.

Some things I built:
* [MoonSharp](http://www.moonsharp.org) - A Lua interpreter written in C# and ready to be embedded in applications and games
* [Waking Violet](https://www.wakingviolet.com/) - A videogame for Windows, MacOS, Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4 and PSVita, iPhone, iPad and AppleTV
* [FSMSharp](https://github.com/xanathar/FSMsharp) - Small finite state machine for .NET languages, written in C#, useful for UIs and games.

All views mine, not my employer's. Maybe not even mine (above all, not my employer's).
If you need further details, that's why I have a [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcomastropaolo/)

### $ ping me

DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mxanathar), [GitHub](https://github.com/xanathar/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcomastropaolo/).

Don't be afraid to contact me for anything, but don't get offended if the answer takes ages to arrive - I'm that lazy.
